## ***Remark***
---
I started taking this course after realizing that I was struggling with solving algorithmic problems. Converting code from JavaScript to Java, which I wasn't familiar with, was quite challenging, but the course proved to be extremely helpful in enhancing my ability to solve algorithmic problems. Now, when I encounter a problem, I no longer stare blankly at the screen; instead, I quickly visualize the problem and proceed to find a solution. I am very grateful to Alvin Zablan for teaching me how to solve algorithmic problems.
